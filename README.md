## What are the main features of Corel Painter 2018?

- **Thick Paint:** This feature lets you apply thick, voluminous strokes of paint that look like real oil or acrylic paints. You can adjust the thickness, lighting, and texture of the paint, and even scrape or blend it with palette knives.
- **Texture Synthesis:** This feature allows you to create unique textures from any image or selection. You can use these textures as brushstrokes, canvas backgrounds, or cloning sources.
- **2.5D Texture Brushes:** These brushes let you paint with depth and dimension by adding impasto effects to your strokes. You can also use them to sculpt or carve into the canvas.
- **Drip and Liquid Technologies:** These technologies let you paint with realistic watercolors, oils, and inks that flow, mix, and interact with the canvas. You can also control the wetness, viscosity, and gravity of the paint.
- **Natural-Media® Brushes:** These brushes mimic the look and feel of traditional art tools, such as pencils, pastels, chalks, charcoal, airbrushes, and more. You can customize them to suit your preferences and techniques.
- **Cloning Tools:** These tools let you transform any photo into a painting by cloning its colors, details, and textures. You can also use them to enhance or modify your photos with artistic effects.
- **Drawing Tools:** These tools let you create precise shapes, lines, curves, and vectors with ease. You can also use them to add text, gradients, patterns, and fills to your artworks.
- **Selection Tools:** These tools let you isolate specific areas of your canvas for editing or applying effects. You can also use them to create masks, layers, channels, and alpha selections.
- **Customization Options:** These options let you tailor your workspace to your workflow and preferences. You can choose from different layouts, themes, palettes, panels, shortcuts, brushes, and more.
